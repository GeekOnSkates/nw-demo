# My NW.js Demo App

This project demonstrates using NW.js as a frontend for programs and scripts written in other languages.  The demo uses both compiled (C#, C++, AutoHotKey) and interpreted (Python, VBScript) languages, and viewing the source for each shows how it works.  To use it:
1. Clone or download the repo on a PC running Windows 7 or later.  I've never tried it on XP.
2. Run nw.exe
3. Enter your name in the text box, and press one of the buttons.  A program or script will run and its text output will appear below the buttons.

Have fun!
